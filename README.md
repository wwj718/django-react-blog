# Django React Blog

This is an example blogging platform written using Django 1.8, React 0.13, and
Flux 2.

**Notice: This is still in active development**

## Running the Application

Once setup, can use application with the following things running:

```
# Run the Django Server First
$ django-admin.py runserver_plus

# Run the watch script with Browser Sync Enabled
$ gulp

# Run the Node server to render React views on the Server
$ node etc/scripts/server.js
```

With those three servers running, you can go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to
preview the application.
